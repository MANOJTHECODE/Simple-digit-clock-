# Simple-digit-clock-
Simple Digit Clock using Python!
# How to Run the Program
To run the program, simply open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the digit-clock.py file. Once you're in the correct directory, run the following command:

python digit-clock.py

This will start the program and the current time will be displayed in the format of a simple digit clock.

# Dependencies
This program requires Python 3 to be installed on your computer. If you don't already have it installed, you can download it from the official Python website.

# Program Details
The digit-clock.py program uses the datetime module in Python to get the current time. It then uses the turtle module to draw the digit clock on the screen.

The program uses a draw_digit() function to draw each digit of the clock. The function takes two arguments: the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the top left corner of the digit. It then uses the turtle module to draw the digit using a series of lines.

The program then calls the draw_time() function to draw the current time on the screen. This function gets the current time using the datetime module and then calls the draw_digit() function to draw each digit of the clock.

The program also uses the time module to update the clock every second. This ensures that the clock displays the correct time.

# Customization
If you want to customize the appearance of the digit clock, you can modify the values in the draw_digit() function. For example, you can change the size of the digits by modifying the size variable.

You can also modify the draw_time() function to change the position of the clock on the screen or to change the font size of the digits.

# Conclusion
That's all there is to it! This program is a simple example of how Python can be used to create a basic digit clock. Feel free to modify and customize the program to fit your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
